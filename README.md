Tandy 1000 HX Internal 3.5" FDD Adapter

This Tandy 1000 Internal Floppy Drive Adapter allows you to add an extra Drive or replace your dead Floppy Drive in Tandy 1000's that send power over the Floppy cable. All you need is an Amiga / Atari ST style Floppy Power cable (as shown) and a compatible Standard 3.5" Floppy Drive. Most drives made up-to-the mid-'90s should work well, but after that compatibility is very much hit and miss as Shugart support was dropped by many OEM's to reduce drive costs.

Tandy 1000's that have power supplied via the Floppy Cable include the HX, SL/2, TX, TL, TL/2, TL/3, RL, RLX and RSX.

For this adapter to work, the rear of the replacement floppy drive should have a similar connector arrangement as the pictured drives - the power connector must at least 12mm away from the Floppy ribbon connector and the floppy ribbon connector notch must be on the bottom of the drive (look for the notch in the PCB).

I made these because many folks want to add a 2nd drive or replace a dead Floppy Drive in their Tandy 1000's but due to the non-standard power-over-cable-design were unable to find a compatible replacement drive.
